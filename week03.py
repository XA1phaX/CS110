Week 3: Variables and Expressions(math)

'''

#### Which are each of the following? (string, int, float)
x = '10'
y = 5
z = 3.14
# print(x*5, y, z*2)

#### What do the following do?
x = int(x)
y = float(y)
z = str(z)

# print(x, y, z+2)

#### Which is better?
# print("I have " + str(x) + " cats.")
# print(f"I have {x} cats.")

#### Order of operations

Operator	Description
()	        Parentheses
**	        Exponent
* / // %	Multiply, Divide, Floor divide, Modulo
+ -	        Addition, Subtraction
= 	        Assign

#### What is stored in a, b, c and d? 
a = 10 + (4 * 2) - 3  
b = 5 % 2  
c = 5 // 2
d = 5 / 2
# print(f'math {a}, modulo {b}, floor divide {c}, normal divide {d}')

#### Team Activity
## Core requirements: 
# get user input (be able to handle ints or floats)
# convert it to a number so you can do some math with it (float)
# calculate areas of 3 shapes

# side = ???(input('What\'s the length of one side: '))
